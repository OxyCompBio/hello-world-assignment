In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing? (1 paragraph max) 


GitHub's largest contribution to helping scientists follow the best practice for scientific computing is developing a system for version control and helping us work in small steps. 
To begin, GitHub intrinsically is a version control system. We can upload an initial, default project to our master in a particular repository, and by creating a new branch off the master, we can create isolated versions of our original project that allows us to test different versions of our projects.  
Additionally, when we edit our project files from each separate branch, we are able to see our potential changes in viewing the files added and changes made to existing files before committing these changes; we can also add comments and our collaborators may add feedback to our changes. 
We've observed both version control (through the branches from the master) and working in small steps (changes to branches). We're also able to work in parallel with other people with the branch function; multiple people can make different branches and everyone's changes may be different. Pull requests for each person's changes will reveal changes, which can be reviewed and feedback may be provided by contributors. 
Overall, GitHub gives us version control and incremental work functionality to help us follow the best practices for computing.
